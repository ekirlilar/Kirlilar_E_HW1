	<h1>Hello! My name is Ece nice to meet you! :)<h1>
		<p>I graduated from Baskent Univercity in Turkey, and I got my Bachelor of Arts diploma in American Studies. I've learned all kinds of media and culture and also how to create a character and how to analize the characters and the characters inside the movies. I know popular culture and its elements, games, movies and animations, and now I also want to learn, how to use all 3D softwares. I want to become a 2D and 3D animator, game designer and visual efect artist. And when I get my diploma from Fanshawe college, I hope I get a 3D animation and game design job in Canada or in States.<p>
